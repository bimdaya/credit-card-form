## ToDos:

Things I could not finish within the given hours:

- Brakedown <DropDownMenu/> and <CreditCardDetails/> components into further levels so that they can be managed easily
- Complete the test cases. I added few as <todos>
- Make the UI design better, more resposive and accessible. 
- Update the current DatePicker with a good design
